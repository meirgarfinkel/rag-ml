Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval of relevant documents with generative AI models.

RAG works by embedding documents into vectors using models like sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2. 
These vectors are stored in FAISS for fast similarity search.

Queries are embedded and matched against document vectors to retrieve relevant context. 
GPT-4o-mini then generates answers grounded in this context.
